But after an unasselved whatsapp in late December, I called me after, I don't know, of course not answering the phone. Then Mox gave me the message, saying someone mistakenly entered HKD1000000. On January 7, I received a Mox letter saying he asked me to reply to a letter before January January 7, otherwise I paid the legal collection of offices. I'm angered, why is it so unreasonable to give time limits when debt chasing my money.\nBut I'm more breathing after the bank's move, and I also called me to get back 100, and 11 January to write a registered letter to me to catch up.\n\nI have replied to the things, why still chasing debt so unstop harassing me, a sorry word. I am more unclear how the disgusting person knows my contact number, what such a big bank is not yet I agree, giving a stranger. The whole thing is the mistakes of banks and quirks, why did it make me look like it's illegal, receiving money and harassing me? I would not have to call the police before I could get an end.",

That\u2019s so user-unfriendly to students, it\u2019s really hard for a student to have mails with their name since they are still living with their parents. Moreover, the only way to proof you are a student is student ID card, however due to COVID-19, oversea student can\u2019t get their student ID card, and the supporter just say you must have student ID in order to create a credit account. How am I able to get student ID from the school if i am having online lesson. Worst visual bank I ever seen.",
