But at the end of December it happened that an unknown person called me after whatsapp, I did not know, of course did not answer the phone. Then Mox gave me a message that someone mistakenly entered me HKD100. On January 7th I received a letter from Mox telling me to reply to the letter before January 7th, otherwise pay the legal charges, I saw the date of the letter was January 4th, I immediately replied that night to the bank agreeing to transfer the money back to this person. I am already angry, why when debt collection chasing my money, still so unreasonable to give a time limit ...\nBut I was more upset by the bank's subsequent move, and called me to get back 100, and on January 11 wrote me a registered letter to collect the debt.\n\nI have replied to them, why the debt collection so constantly harassing me, not a word of apology. I further do not understand how an unknown person knows my contact number, exactly why such a large bank has not had my consent, given to this stranger. The whole thing is the bank and this stranger's mistake, why does it make me seem to be breaking the law, receiving money and still nuisance me? Do I need to call the police to end this matter?",

Called again to ask did not explain the real reason, only said security reasons, the system actively lock the account but open anti-account to passively wait for the relevant departments to start work, but also the weather, typhoon to wait longer D, and then nothing Compensation, I am entirely responsible for the risk/loss among them.
