<iframe src="https://www.yeschat.ai/i/gpts-2OTogtFkBR-Summarizer-GPT" width="800" height="500" style="max-width: 100%;">The mox app design interface is confusing and ugly. Hope to increase the visibility, otherwise I only use mox as an Octopus,. Hopefully than choose whether to use a password. . Also can it be as simple as Octopus every transaction to see the balance. You don't have to log in every time to see it. .
    Could not update on 23/10 & got stuck!
    I cannot do anything now!
    Please fix asap
    Can‚Äôt use after the latest update, please fix
    When I opened the App this morning, I saw that the Mox program was being downloaded.
    Please wait or restart the program later. Sorry, we found some problems. Please restart the program. What is it?      
    Cannot open the app after update.
    dllm is updated every time I use it
    The in-app support chat is a chaos. Not address to the problem, but keep selling the thing I don‚Äôt want. Delayed in reply to my inquiry, and end the conversation once I am not replying immediately. Such unfair! And I cannot continue the conversation once I come back.
    Fake9 people said there was a refund, but they kept pushing Bo ZaiüòÖ
    You will lose more than you gain in this rubbish bank totally bad service and strict.
    Positive garbage
    No one will ever pay attention to you on a video call, and no one will answer your phone, but you have to force people to do so
    hello I do not know what your company does suddenly cut my card, sd online text message and not reply to me, say what instant reply sister, phone I called at least four 20 minutes can not call your customer service, completely unclear Why lock my card because I applied for a credit card? So you approve me again? What does it have to do with me? I've been using it for so long, and suddenly it's not for me to use, and for some reason and why, that's how the problem is handled? It's really bad üòÖüòÖüòÖ Before I was still introducing my friends to use your bank, it turned out that this is how the problem is handled, the handling is not satisfactory I will continue to bother all! Please reply to my email as soon as possible, I have not tried to call once is needed can not be called, but also not any customer service reply to me! The attitude of handling things is really bad is outright does not care
    For those whom may download Mox, please be aware that to use credit card. It will deduct your money AUTOMATICALLY without any approval from the internet (i.e. Apple.com fm different country of yours)!
    No trusting and unsecured credit card!!!
    If u wanted, please just using the debit card and no information given on any other internet payment! If u use the CC, u will regret!! If u don‚Äôt trust me, you could search ‚ÄúMox Apple.com‚Äù, you will be found what I am saying. Good Luck~
    The upper corner icons cannot be sensed in new iOS version. Cannot click notification or the name of account, the developers of MOX bank apps, please upgrade and tackle this bug!
    good
    Update again??
    Frequent crashes. Today I cannot access my account at all.
    App is user-friendly and works flawlessly. Definitely recommended!
    the video call to identity verification is just too awkward. I couldn't hear the voice from speaker, so that I have to put my phone near my ear. however the staff said need to see my face during the process. No button on screen to change the audio output options. I need to change the position of my phone, and the camera just showing everywhere of my home. also there is no information to let me know if Mox will keep the footage of the video call. I feel my privacy is unprotected
    There's a bug in the app, leading to false claims, but Mox denied it's their responsibility. Will never use them again.
    Terrible app. One day, just stopped me from logging in with a "Something went wrong" issue. Upon calling for customer support, was dropped off after 15 minutes of waiting. There is no other way of reaching the team, as the email directs to the same number. Closing my account once this is resolved</iframe>
